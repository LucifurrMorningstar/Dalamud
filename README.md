# Fun Fact Countdown
https://github.com/LucifurrMorningstar/FunFactCountdown

Use /ffcd to start a countdown and send fun facts to your chat at specified intervals.
For example: **"/ffcd 15 10 5 0"** will start a 15s countdown and send a fun fact at **10s, 5s, and 0s**. If you don't specify any intervals, a Fun Fact is sent every second of the countdown (i.e. "/ffcd 15")
